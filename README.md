## About
Made by Cameron Samuels in June 2017 using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
<br />
I was inspired by <a href="http://keycode.info">keycode.info</a>, getting some of the ideas and style of it (font, and user friendly key names).
<br />
I used <a href="http://brackets.io">Adobe Brackets</a>, <a href="http://bitballoon.com"><strike>BitBalloon</strike></a>, <strike>BitBucket</strike>, GitHub, <strike>SourceTree</strike>, and Chrome on Lenovo & Windows 7.
