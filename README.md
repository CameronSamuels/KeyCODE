## About

I used <a href="http://brackets.io">Adobe Brackets</a> for the code editor, GitHub for the source control (I used to use BitBucket), <strike>SourceTree</strike> for the source control, <a href="http://bitballoon.com"><strike>BitBalloon</strike></a> for publishing (now Github Pages), <strike>BitBucket</strike>, and Chrome on Lenovo & Windows 7.
